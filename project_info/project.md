## My Wedding Photobooth Plan


##### Overview
Core Features:
    * A Photo booth, utilizing my Canon T1i DSLR camera, a monitor, a TBD imput trigger.
    * Saves photos, shares to web server and display
    * Separate Pi computer is client and displaying the photos elsewhere at the wedding.

Mainly uses the photo-booth app already existing, using Electron. But adding features:


  * Beep on countdown after starting Photobooth
  * add "Becca & Brian" watermark to photos.
  * Printer which prints the photos they like (maybe there is a "keep" & "delete" option after each)
  *
